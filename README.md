# old-node-landingpage
A few years old landing page stripped from a bit larger web application, where some of its features were/are deactivated.
Some of the metacommentary and contents are in finnish sadly, but it should showcase somewhat of it.

## Instructions for running the project locally
### 1. I recommend downloading the newest LTS version of Node.js available from:
- https://nodejs.org/en
### 2. After downloading Node.js, head to the project's root directory and type
```
npm install
```
### 3. After installing of the Node.js modules is done, you may start the project
```
npm start
```

Now the project should open in your browser of choice on localhost:3000.
